# TrustLayer: The Decentralized Reputation and ID Layer

**TrustLayer** is a plug-in system where users build a verifiable, on-chain reputation from their real-world and digital actions. From repaying a loan to completing a freelance gig, TrustLayer translates these actions into a portable reputation score that is usable across any dApp in the decentralized ecosystem.

## üåü Features

  * **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Users create a unique, self-sovereign identity anchored to their crypto wallet.
  * **Action Verification:** A protocol for verifying user actions on the blockchain, such as completed tasks, successful transactions, or contributions.
  * **Portable Reputation:** A reputation score that is not tied to a single platform but can be leveraged across multiple dApps to unlock new opportunities.
  * **Developer-Friendly API:** A simple and secure API for developers to query user reputation scores and integrate them into their own applications.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (version X.X.X)
  * Yarn or npm
  * A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

## üõ† For Developers

Integrating TrustLayer into your dApp is simple.

### Quick Start

1.  **Get an API Key:**
    Sign up on the TrustLayer platform to get a unique API key.

2.  **Make a Query:**
    Use a simple API call to retrieve a user's reputation score.

    ```bash
    # Example using curl
    curl -X GET "https://api.trustlayer.io/v1/reputation?address=0xYourWalletAddress" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

3.  **Utilize the Score:**
    Use the returned score to enhance your application's logic. For example, you could offer a lower interest rate on a loan or grant access to exclusive features.
